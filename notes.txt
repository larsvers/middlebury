Data
----

1) we can load in the data as JSON
2) then send it through the pack layout 

* for the map and the bars we only use the nodes * without * children
* all nodes * with * children only manifest in the circle packing and can trun turn opaque or the like for the map



Problem 1
---------

Problem: nodes don't transition back from circle pack to map simulation

Area: positionMap() positionPack()

Hypothesis: it seems when kicking off the second map simulation that the simulation thinks the nodes are already at their final positions. 
Seems I need to check where x y is before the first map simulation and where x y are before the second map simulation.

Fix: Before the second+ map positioning (positionMap()) set the x and y properties to the current circle packing positions.
As we don't simulate from map to circle-pack, but transition, the x and y properties (which get changed in the tick function)
remain on the last map position. Hence a newly triggered simulation just simulates them from the final map position to the 
final map position.
